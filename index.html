<h1> RailsGame </h1>

<h2> Installing </h2>

<p>
  First, install the RailsGame gem: "sudo gem install
  noahgibbs-railsgame --source http://gems.github.com".
</p>

<p>
  You'll also need a Rails project.  Type "rails myproject" in
  the correct location, just as you always would.
</p>

<p>
  Generate crypto keys for your project: "./script/generate
    rg_crypto_keys" will do it.  [NOTE: need to add something to
  handle environment variable when this is run, just as ./run_server.sh
  does.]
</p>

<p>
  Soon: generate a RailsGame view: "./script/generate rg_scaffold &lt;name&gt;"
  where name is the name of the controller.
</p>
