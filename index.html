<h1> RailsGame </h1>

<h2> Installing RailsGame </h2>

<p>
  To <a href="install.html">learn about installing RailsGame, click here</a>.
</p>

<h2> Running RailsGame </h2>

<p>
  Mostly you'll type "./run_server.sh" from the correct directory.  For
  more detail about <a href="running.html">running your RailsGame, click
  here</a>.
</p>

<h2> Build a RailsGame! </h2>

<p>
  You could download an existing RailsGame project and modify it.
  Currently, that means <a href="http://noahgibbs.github.com/RailsMUD">
  RailsMUD</a>.  Soon there will be a graphical example game also.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you start with an example or from
  scratch, <a href="building/">see our information on how to make a
  RailsGame</a>.
</p>

<h2> What's a RailsGame? </h2>

<p>
  A RailsGame is a browser-game with a few simple extras -- you can
  easily push data out to the players who are connected to you, and
  that gives you a bit of realtime "oomph" that most browser-games
  don't have.
</p>

<p>
  A RailsGame is made of a Rails web site, a game server, and a lot of
  glue to connect them.  The plugin supplies most of the glue, and a
  lot of libraries for the game server.  The rest is up to you.
</p>

<h2> Why RailsGame? </h2>

<p>
  If you want to write a browsergame with two-way capabilities, this
  is a way to avoid using something like Juggernaut
  (<a href="http://github.com/maccman/juggernaut_plugin">Juggernaut
  plugin</a>, <a href="http://github.com/maccman/juggernaut_gem">Juggernaut
  gem</a>) or <a href="http://orbited.org">Orbited</a> for yourself,
  or an example of how to use them.
</p>

<p>
  See our <a href="features.html">Feature Comparison</a> for why you
  might want to use RailsGame rather than a standard web development
  kit (like Rails), or Flash, or a two-way server like a MUD.
</p>

<h2> Who Can Use a RailsGame? </h2>

<p>
  Currently, anybody with Flash 8 or higher installed in their browser of
  choice.  That's almost everybody, these days.  RailsGame is compatible
  with Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, and many others.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the specific game also has to support any browser you
  want to use with it.
</p>

<h2> Do I Need This To Play? </h2>

<p>
  No.  The only reason to read this site is if you want
  to <b>build</b> a RailsGame, and you're a pretty
  decent <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> programmer
  already.
</p>

<h3> About RailsGame Itself </h3>

<p>
  This stuff is if you want to do something more involved, or work on
  RailsGame itself.
