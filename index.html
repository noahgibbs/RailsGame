<h2> Installing RailsGame </h2>

<p>
  To <a href="install.html">learn about installing RailsGame, click here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You could also download an existing RailsGame project and modify it.
  Currently, that means <a href="http://noahgibbs.github.com/RailsMUD">
  RailsMUD</a>.
</p>

<h2> What's a RailsGame? </h2>

<p>
  A RailsGame is a browser-game with a few simple extras -- you can
  easily push data out to the players who are connected to you, and
  that gives you a bit of realtime "oomph" that most browser-games
  don't have.
</p>

<p>
  A RailsGame is made of a Rails web site, a game server, and a lot of
  glue to connect them.  The plugin supplies most of the glue, and a
  lot of libraries for the game server.  The rest is up to you.
</p>

<h2> Who Can Use a RailsGame? </h2>

<p>
  Currently, anybody with Flash 8 or higher installed in their browser of
  choice.  That's almost everybody, these days.  RailsGame is compatible
  with Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, and many others.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the specific game also has to support any browser you
  want to use with it.
</p>

<h2> Do I Need This To Play? </h2>

<p>
  No.  The only reason to read this site is if you want
  to <b>build</b> a RailsGame, and you're a pretty
  decent <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> programmer
  already.
</p>

<h2> Building a RailsGame </h2>

<p>
  You'll need to make a lot of design decisions when you do.
