RailsGame example, building from the ground up

You must have Redis and Juggernaut installed.  Redis can be downloaded
or installed through most package managers.  Juggernaut must be
installed via npm -- see http://github.com/maccman/juggernaut.

To start, use foreman:

  $ bundle install
  $ foreman start

This will start all relevant servers (there are several).
