<h1> Running a RailsGame </h1>

<p>
  Did you already <a href="install.html">install RailsGame</a>?
</p>

<p>
  After that, just edit private_variables.sh (see below) and then
  type "./run_server.sh".  Eventually you'll want a larger, more robust
  deployment, but in the beginning you should just run everything on
  a single server.
</p>

<p>
  Having trouble?  The TROUBLESHOOTING file may help.
</p>

<h2> Editing private_variables.sh </h2>

<p>
  In your new RailsGame project that you created from the template,
  find the file called "private_variables.sh".  You'll need to tell it
  the address your game will be running at (maybe "localhost"?)  and
  the port number to run at (pick something distinctive).  You'll also
  need to name your game.  Don't worry, you can go back and change it
  later, so you could just leave the sample name.
</p>

<p>
  Once you get to the optional and advanced stuff later in the file,
  you can probably stop, especially if your eyes have already glazed
  over.
</p>

<h2> Email Activation </h2>

<p>
  If you said you wanted email activation, you'll need to give valid
  info for your mail server.  That's probably information from your
  ISP, a lot like when you set up your email client.  If you do that,
  your game will send email from your address at your ISP when people
  sign up for new accounts.  That's probably what you want it to do.
</p>

<p>
  You'll also need to give an email address for yourself that's valid.
  A lot of places won't accept an invalid "from" address, to prevent
  spamming.  So for the admin email address, use a real one.
