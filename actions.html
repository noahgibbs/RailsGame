<h1> RailsGame Actions </h1>

<p>
  Any RailsGame will have the standard actions "login" and "logout"
  defined.  Other actions are defined by the game server, or by the
  game server along with the client JavaScript, the Rails server, or
  both.
</p>

<h2> Predefined Actions </h2>

<p>
  For actions that you'll always allow, it's usually best to include
  the JavaScript to send or receive them in the JavaScript you serve
  up statically in your RailsGame view.  That way the client can
  request it (perhaps with a link or button) and receive the
  JavaScript function calls in response with minimal management on the
  game server's part.
</p>

<p>
  It's possible to write JavaScript on the client side to send any action,
  and you don't control the client.  Remember, tools like GreaseMonkey will
  let them send anything.  Never trust the client code!  So even if you
  don't include JavaScript to send you an action, always verify actions that
  are received via Juggernaut.  They can be faked!
</p>

<p>
  It's also possible to automatically generate action names and parse
  them on the client side.  I'll leave that as an exercise to the
  reader -- the code to send and receive them is pretty easy, but you
  should only do that if you really know what you're doing!
