<h1> RailsGame Security </h1>

<p>
  Security in RailsGame is primarily aimed at securing the Juggernaut
  message bus between components.  The game server doesn't generally
  accept incoming connections, and Rails is already pretty well
  secured in the ways that matter.
</p>

<p>
  There are several different stages to secure.
</p>

<h3> Game Server Subscription </h3>

<p>
  The game server initially connects to Juggernaut.  The Rails server will
  be consulted on this (via the subscribe URL), and should accept the
  subscribe request only if the game server includes the correct shared
  secret as the session ID.
</p>

<h3> Client subscription </h3>

<p>
  Clients send their Rails session keys when they subscribe to
  Juggernaut, and Juggernaut checks them for validity with the Rails
  server.  This prevents clients from subscribing without a valid
  session.  However, clients can't subscribe to anything sensitive
  anyway.  Global chat should be available to anybody, even people who
  aren't logged in.
</p>

<p>
  However, the game server sends world output to specific client IDs,
  so it's good that only a real session ID works to subscribe.
</p>

<h3> Game Server Broadcasts </h3>

<p>
  The game server can send to clients, singularly or collectively,
  through Juggernaut.  Since the current game server sends to clients
  by client ID, it doesn't count as a broadcast.  This means that
  Juggernaut doesn't have the check the broadcast URL, and that security
  is handled by the players' initial subscription requests.
</p>

<p>
  A different game server, one that had some kind of sub-channels (per
  region?) would need to do a bit more authenticating here.  For the
  moment, this isn't a problem.
</p>

<h3> Rails Server Broadcasts </h3>

<p>
  In a few cases, primarily login and logout, the Rails server will
  send through Juggernaut as well.  The clients won't normally need to
  verify this -- they're trusting Rails not to let anything bad over
  the Juggernaut bus in the first place, and they're usually not the
  recipients of the broadcast.  The game server can verify this with
  the same shared secret used in the other direction.
</p>
