<h1> RailsGame Architecture </h1>

<h3> Modular Components </h3>

<p>
  There is a strong tradition in both the Rails and open-source game
  communities of starting with an app or server configuration and
  changing out parts of it for different purposes.  That's a powerful
  piece of the culture, and RailsGame aims to support it well.  As
  such, this document is written with the assumption that components
  are modular, and describes how they could be changed out.  But
  realistically, most people will use the defaults, so it also
  mentions the configuration "out of the box".  This is a high-level
  overview document, so it's appropriate to put more emphasis on
  modularity here.
</p>

<h3> Basic Components </h3>

<img src="railsgame_diagram.png" alt="A diagram of interacting servers" />

<h3> Rails Server (part standard, part custom) </h3>

<p>
  This is a standard Rails server running a smallish Rails app.  It's
  got the Juggernaut plugin installed, and has at least one controller
  and a couple of views for the game client.  You can keep building a
  standard Rails-based site around this with no trouble, in the same
  way you would without the game components.
</p>

<p>
  In a few cases, the Rails server might want to directly query the
  game server, or even (not recommended) redirect HTTP queries to the
  game server.  This is represented by the gray dotted line.  Normally
  information should be exchanged via the database or MemCacheD rather
  than having the client or Rails server directly query the game server.
</p>

<h3> Juggernaut Server (standard) </h3>

<p>
  Juggernaut is effectively a message bus between the other components
  in the diagram -- game server, Rails server and clients.  The Rails
  server and clients have the usual non-Juggernaut connections as
  well, while the game server is meant to interact only through
  Juggernaut.
</p>

<p>
  Juggernaut is used in several ways.  The first is as a chat server
  between players.  Normally this chat can go purely through
  Juggernaut from player to player, and the game server doesn't even
  need to see it.  An exception might be made for cases where some
  in-game entity monitors and responds to chat.  It's often easier to
  run a chatbot completely separately from the game server.  This all
  takes place on Juggernaut channel 'chat', which has fairly light
  security.
</p>

<p>
  The second purpose for Juggernaut is to collect in-game player
  actions and send them to the game server.  This is on a different
  channel from in-game chat.  These actions may be considered
  "declarations of intent" rather than full actions, in the sense that
  the server may simply deny them.  All results of the actions are
  determined by the server, not the client.  This takes place on
  channel 'action', which only the game server may subscribe to, but
  any validly logged-in player may send to.
</p>

<p>
  The juggernaut server is entirely standard, except for a small
  configuration file telling it how to interface to your Rails app.
</p>

<h3> Game Server </h3>

<p>
  The game server is very much like a traditional non-WWW networked
  game server in most ways.  It keeps a connection to the Juggernaut
  server and polls it regularly.  It keeps periodic functions
  ('heartbeat functions' in MUD parlance) running for ongoing activity
  in the game world.
</p>

<p>
  It's been mentioned several times that by having a Ruby game server
  running a standard ORM, you can standardize the programming model.
  That's true.  But it's not an architectural requirement.  As long as
  the game server can communicate in Juggernaut's (very simple)
  protocol, it can serve its purpose quite adequately.  Having easy
  access to a variety of good database interfaces is just a bonus.
</p>

<p>
  The game server is shown as a single entity in this diagram, but
  that doesn't need to be true.  It doesn't even technically need to
  limit itself to a single Juggernaut connection -- though it's
  important not to swamp the Juggernaut server with too many
  connections that are subscribed to all player actions.  A more
  complex game running on more machines could easily have different
  sub-servers separated by purpose or by in-game geography calculating
  different parts of the game world.
</p>

<p>
  The game server should never directly interact with the clients.
  It's important to secure this server, and the easiest way to do that
  is to limit it to connecting with the Juggernaut server and any
  sub-game-servers it may manage.
</p>

<p>
  The game server is shown connected to the database, and I think
  that's a good design.  However, there's an inherent tradeoff between
  keeping game data in the database or in the server.  Database-backed
  data is easy to query, very reliable, easy to back up, but slow to
  use.  In-server data is fast, can be manipulated in the local
  format, and can have very predictable access time.  Perhaps more
  importantly, database-backed data is the only kind of data that can
  be easily queried by the Rails server.  If you want your game to
  have web pages showing lists of logged-in users, updated high
  scores, or other game data, it's usually a very good idea to store
  those things in the database and update them appropriately.
</p>

<h3> Database </h3>

<p>
  The database is used from the Ruby on Rails server as you'd expect,
  and can be accessed from the game server via ActiveRecord,
  DataMapper, or any other technology of your choice.  If you pick a
  common Ruby ORM like ActiveRecord or DataMapper, you can get a very
  similar programming model between the game server and the Rails
  server.  RailsMUD demonstrates basic use of ActiveRecord.
</p>

<p>
  Any database that's compatible with Rails is fine, though SQLite may
  not scale well -- you've got the game server process potentially
  accessing it as well.  Normally MySQL and PostgreSQL would be the
  obvious choices here.  The default is SQLite, but that should be
  changed for larger applications.
</p>

<p>
  MemcacheD, if present, can also be used to exchange information
  between the game server and the Rails server.  It's treated as
  interchangeable with the database in this diagram, though it's
  important what you store in which one.  The database is slower, more
  reliable, easier to back up and can be used for important persistent
  data.  MemCacheD is for transient data or data that can be
  regenerated, or that is only interesting for a given login session.
  Of course it's possible to use MemCacheD as a cache for data which
  is also in the database, though that's a bit more complex.
</p>

<h3> Clients </h3>

<p>
  The clients are standard web browsers.  Juggernaut compatibility
  requires Flash to be installed, at least at version 8.  Most of the
  "game client" being run is in JavaScript, and runs in the browser in
  the standard way.  Flash is only used to send JavaScript and text
  for server-pushed chat and responses from the game world.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the server-pushed information isn't limited to text.  It's
  perfectly possible to send any valid HTML or JavaScript, so images
  and animations work.  Given appropriate plugins, anything you could
  put in a web page is fair game.
