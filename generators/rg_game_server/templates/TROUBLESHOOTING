TROUBLESHOOTING

* When I try to log in, I get a weird database error about not finding a table!

A: Have you run "rake db:migrate", like it says in the INSTALL file?


* When I try to log in, I get a weird error about an MX record!

A: Have you made sure that the admin email address in private_variables.sh
is valid and spelled correctly?


* When I do "run_server.sh", it starts, then the game server immediately
disconnects!

A: Type "./rails/server".  Are you getting an error message?  If so, you'll
need to fix it.  If you didn't change anything, you could try Googling the
error.  Maybe something has the wrong version?

* When I run scripts or rake tasks, I get some weird error about
'ensure_secret_secure'.  What's up with that?

You'll need to source the crypto_keys.sh file, and maybe also
private_variables.sh.  When you do 'run_server.sh' it does this for you.
To source the file, go to the Rails directory and type ". crypto_keys.sh"
and ". private_variables.sh".

If you don't have a "crypto_keys.sh" file, type "./script/generate
rg_crypto_keys" to generate one.  Normally "./run_script.sh" should
do this for you the first time you run it.
