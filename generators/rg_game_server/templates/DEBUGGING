*** Server lifetime:

The game server runs until it disconnects from Juggernaut, or is
interrupted with a key combination like CTRL-C.

*** Server output:

There are two output logs to look at, plus the console.  The file
juggernaut.yml.output contains output from the Juggernaut server.  If
you find invalid requests in there, or evidence of error codes or
server errors, that may be part of your problem.

The file log/development.log (or a different name if you're not using
the 'development' Rails environment) contains the output from the
Rails server.  That can be used to see what URLs have been accessed,
and what status codes the server returned.

Right now, game server output just goes to the console.  You'll see it
as the server runs.

*** Does something just not run?

Daemons especially don't always say anything when they get an
immediate startup error.

Try running the components individually.  "ruby rails_control.rb run"
for Rails, "ruby juggernaut_control.rb run" for Juggernaut, and
./game/server for the Game server -- but remember, the game server
depends on the other two!  So you may need to use 'start' instead of
'run' to run them in daemon mode.
