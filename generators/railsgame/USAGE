Description:
    This creates the file of cryptographic keys for RailsGame.  Normally
    it gets invoked automatically by run_server.sh, but you could regenerate
    the keys manually if you wanted.  Regenerating the keys will invalidate
    all current connections and sessions, including the game server, so you
    should shut everything down first.  Users with web browsers will have to
    log in again.

Example:
    ./script/generate rg_crypto_keys [unused name]

    This will create:
        crypto_keys.sh
