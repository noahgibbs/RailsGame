Description:
    This generator creates a RailsGame controller and view, including
    connection to a Juggernaut server.  Initially this contains a
    peer-to-peer chat window and a simple output area for the game server.

Example:
    ./script/generate rg_scaffold GameClient

    This would create a GameClientController and a GameClientView.
