<h1> RailsGame Containers </h1>

<p>
  A RailsGame-enabled view connects to Juggernaut, which receives
  actions from the client and sends JavaScript to evaluate.  But what
  does that JavaScript do, and how does it turn into user-visible DOM
  objects?
</p>

<p>
  The answer is that it finds or creates RailsGame Containers, and
  then updates their contents.
</p>

<h2> What's a Container? </h2>

<p>
  A container is a DOM object that can have its innerHTML updated.
  Usually that's a DIV or an IFRAME, though technically nothing's
  stopping you from using something unusual like a PRE or P tag.
</p>

<p>
  Right now (August 2009), containers should be set up in the HTML
  files sent to the client.  That's easy, and allows for easy updates,
  but won't be true forever.
</p>

<h2> Statically Created Containers </h2>

<p>
  Statically created containers already exist in the HTML for the
  RailsGame-enabled view.  It's important to set the ID field on your
  container so that updates (whether appending or replacing HTML) are
  easy.
</p>

<p>
  Another advantage of this method is that it's easy to write
  JavaScript functions for updates.  Just write a little function that
  adds to or replaces the HTML in the static container, and then send
  JavaScript from the server that calls the function with the right
  argument.  Voila!
</p>

<h2> Dynamically Created Containers </h2>

<p>
  It's also possible to send JavaScript to define new functions, and
  to add new DOM objects.  That's one way to add a new RailsGame
  container (again, usually a DIV or IFRAME) that can later be
  updated.
</p>

<p>
  If you do this, you'll need to either include JavaScript to load a
  new (dynamic?) CSS file, or you'll need to update the style on your
  new dynamic container appropriately.
