<h1> RailsGame </h1>

<h2> Installing - For Builders </h2>

<p>
  <b><i>NOTE: this probably won't work yet!  We're still rolling our first
  end-user release.  You'll probably need to use the "RailsGame
  Developers" instructions below instead of this!  If you're not very
  confident in your Rails-fu don't do it at all yet!</i></b>
</p>

<p>
  First, install the RailsGame gem: "sudo gem install railsgame".
</p>

<p>
  Then, you'll want to create a Rails project using the template.  One
  good way to do that is "rails -m `gem environment
  gemdir`/gems/railsgame*/rails/railsgame.rb myrailsgame".  This uses
  a template to make a new RailsGame project.
</p>

<p>
  You'll need to answer a couple of questions for the template.  If
  you say to use RESTful authentication then the web site will allow
  people to create accounts, and by default they'll have to use them
  to play your game.
</p>

<p>
  If you tell it to use email activation, people will need to give a
  valid email address and click a "confirm" link in order to make
  their accounts.
</p>

<p>
  If you tell it to create an initial repository, it'll set up Git for
  all your code, check it in, and create a .gitignore file that's
  probably what you want.  Even if you're the only one working on your
  game, use source code control.  Git is pretty good, but use whatever
  you're comfortable with.
</p>

<h2> Installing - For RailsGame Developers </h2>

<p>
  Grab the <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsGame">RailsGame
  source from GitHub</a>.  You can install it locally via "rake
  install_gem", like any other project that uses NewGem.  The gem name
  will be noahgibbs-railsgame.
</p>

<p>
  Now that you have the game in place, follow the instructions above
  to make a new RailsGame project from the template.  Where it says
  "railsgame*" in the command line above, you'll need to use
  "noahgibbs-railsgame*" instead.  You could also directly use the
  same template file from the RailsGame source directory.
</p>
