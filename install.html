<h1> RailsGame </h1>

<h2> Installing - For Builders </h2>

<p>
  First, install the RailsGame gem: "sudo gem install railsgame".
</p>

<p>
  Then, you'll want to create a Rails project using the template.  One
  good way to do that is "rails -m `gem environment
  gemdir`/gems/railsgame*/rails/railsgame.rb myproject".  This uses the
  template in your version of RailsGame to make a new RailsGame-enabled
  project.
</p>

<h2> Installing - For RailsGame Developers </h2>

<p>
  If you want to work on RailsGame itself, it's not a bad idea to
  start like the above, but you'll want to dig deeper before long.
</p>

<p>
  The best way to dig deeper is probably to grab the
  <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsGame">RailsGame source
  from GitHub</a>.  You can install it locally via "rake install_gem",
  like any other project using NewGem, though that'll change the name
  to something like noahgibbs-railsgame, so beware.  That probably
  means making changes in the template (if you use it) or
  config/environment.rb to load the right local version instead of
  using the released RubyForge version of the gem.  Caveat Emptor.
