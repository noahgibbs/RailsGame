<h2> Optimization Hints </h2>

<p>
  From the user's perspective, a RailsGame is a browsergame, so it's
  made of web pages.  Once you get into the meat of the game -- the
  part that has a lot of two-way communicating between the browser and
  your server -- you'll want to leave one RailsGame-enabled page up
  instead of switching from one to another.  It takes time to connect
  to the game server, and you're better off doing it once than doing
  it repeatedly.
