<h1> RailsGame Containers </h1>

<p>
  Containers are 'windows' in the user's browser for things like
  player-to-player chat, or pictures of who is nearby, or the section
  of a game map that the player can see.

An example of an interface divided into containers
</div>

<p>
  The example above isn't RailsGame, but it illustrates the point
  nicely.  There are five separate sub-windows in the interface above.
  One is a "game output" window (left), another is for player chat
  (top), two are maps (lower right) and one is the player's condition
  (center).  This would correspond to five containers, in RailsGame
  parlance.
</p>

<h2> Static vs Dynamic Containers </h2>

<p>
  Where possible, it's better to use static containers.  A static
  container is part of the HTML that Rails serves up to the client.
  To display into it, RailsGame sends simple JavaScript calls to
  change the contents, whether that's adding output to a div area
  (rectangular region of a page), or updating a map.
</p>

<p>
  Alternately, RailsGame can create a dynamic container.  It isn't
  part of the HTML that Rails sends to the client.  Instead, your game
  server will send JavaScript code to create it after the browser has
  already connected.  That's important if you want to have player
  preferences about what parts are visible (see the diagram above --
  what if the player didn't want the chat window displayed, for
  instance?), or if the container might vary significantly from player
  to player, or only exist sometimes (a pop-up form to fill out, say).
</p>

<p>
  A dynamic container must have its JavaScript sent from your game
  server rather than the Rails server, and the request can't be
  cached.  Where possible, use static containers instead.  But in some
  cases, only a dynamic container will allow the effect you want.
</p>

<p>
  Note that for simple effects, you can often use a static container
  and HTML or CSS even when it sounds like an obvious case for a
  dynamic container.  For instance, a pop-up that will always look the
  same could be loaded invisible (with style "display:none") and only
  made visible when you use it, for instance.  Differences in location
  and presence of frames or divs in your page could be set by
  different locations, sizes and display settings in a dynamic CSS
  stylesheet with the same HTML.  Consider whether you need a dynamic
  container, or just a static container with a few flourishes that
  Rails can already provide.
